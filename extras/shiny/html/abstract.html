<h2>Abstract</h2>
<b>Objective</b>: To compare different risk-based methods for optimal prediction
of individualized treatment effects. <b>Study design and seteting</b>: We simulated
RCT data using diverse assumptions for the average treatment effect, a baseline
prognostic index of risk (PI), the shape of its interaction with treatment
(none, linear, quadratic or non-monotonic), and the magnitude of
treatment-related harms (none or constant independent of the PI). We predicted
absolute benefit using: models with a constant relative treatment effect;
stratification in quarters of the PI; models including a linear interaction of
treatment with the PI; models including an interaction of treatment with a
restricted cubic spline (RCS) transformation of the PI; an adaptive approach
using Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion. We evaluated predictive performance using
root mean squared error and measures of discrimination and calibration for
benefit. <b>Results</b>: The linear-interaction model and the RCS-interaction
displayed robust performance across many simulation scenarios. The RCS-model
was optimal when quadratic or non-monotonic deviations from a constant
treatment effect were stronger, and when sample size was larger. The adaptive
approach required larger sample sizes. Illustrations in the GUSTO-I trial
confirmed these findings. <b>Conclusion</b>: An interaction between baseline risk
and treatment assignment should be considered to improve treatment effect
predictions.
