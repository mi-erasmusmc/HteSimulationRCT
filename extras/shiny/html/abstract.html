<h2>Abstract</h2>
<b>Objective</b>: To compare different risk-based methods for optimal prediction
of treatment effects. <b>Study Design and Setting</b>: We simulated RCT data
using diverse assumptions for the average treatment effect, a baseline
prognostic index of risk (PI), the shape of its interaction with treatment
(none, linear, quadratic or non-monotonic), and the magnitude of
treatment-related harms (none or constant independent of the PI). We predicted
absolute benefit using: models with a constant relative treatment effect;
stratification in quarters of the PI; models including a linear interaction of
treatment with the PI; models including an interaction of treatment with a
restricted cubic spline (RCS) transformation of the PI; an adaptive approach
using Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion. We evaluated predictive performance
using root mean squared error and measures of discrimination and calibration
for benefit. <b>Results</b>: The linear-interaction model displayed optimal or
close-to-optimal performance across many simulation scenarios with moderate
sample size (N=4,250; ~800 events). The RCS-model was optimal for strong
non-linear deviations from a constant treatment effect, particularly when
sample size was larger (N=17,000). The adaptive approach also required larger
sample sizes. These findings were illustrated in the GUSTO-I
trial. <b>Conclusion</b>: An interaction between baseline risk and treatment
assignment should be considered to improve treatment effect predictions.
