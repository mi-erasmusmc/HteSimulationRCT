<p>The linear interaction and the RCS-3 models displayed very good performance
under many of the considered simulation scenarios. The linear interaction model
was optimal in cases with moderate sample sizes (4.250 patients; ~785 events)
and moderately performing baseline risk prediction models, that is, it had lower
RMSE, was better calibrated for benefit and had better discrimination for
benefit, even in scenarios with strong quadratic deviations. In scenarios with
true non-monotonic deviations, the linear interaction model was outperformed by
RCS-3, especially in the presence of treatment-related harms. Increasing the
sample size or the prediction model’s discriminative ability favored RCS-3,
especially in scenarios with strong non-linear deviations from a constant
treatment effect.</p>
<p>Our simulation results clearly express the trade-off between the advantages of
flexibly modeling the relationship between baseline risk and treatment effect
and the disadvantages of overfitting this relationship to the sample at hand. With
infinite sample size, the more flexible approach (here RCS) will be optimal, but
in practice, with limited sample size, parsimonious models may be
preferable. Even with the substantial sample size of our base case scenario, the
(less flexible) linear interaction model performed better than the (more
flexible) RCS approach for most simulation settings. The even less flexible
constant treatment effect model, however, was only optimal when the treatment
effect was truly constant. Moreover, the assumption of a constant treatment
effect may often be too strong <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Kent2016" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Rothwell1995" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>. For example, infants
at lower risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia benefit relatively more from vitamin
A therapy than infants at higher risk <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Rysavy2021" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>; higher risk prediabetic
patients benefit relatively more from metformin than lower risk patients
<span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Sussman2015" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span>. Hence, a linear interaction between baseline risk and the effect
of treatment may be the most sensible approach with moderate sample sizes.</p>
<p>RCS-4 and RCS-5 were too flexible in all considered scenarios, as indicated by
higher RMSE, increased variability of discrimination for benefit and worse
calibration of benefit predictions. Even with larger sample sizes and strong
quadratic or non-monotonic deviations, these more flexible methods did not
outperform the simpler RCS-3 approach. Higher flexibility may only be helpful
under more extreme patterns of HTE compared to the quadratic deviations
considered here. Considering interactions in RCS-3 models as the most complex
approach often may be reasonable.</p>
<p>Increasing the discriminative ability of the risk model reduced RMSE for all
methods. Higher discrimination translates in higher variability of predicted
risks, which, in turn, allows the considered methods to better capture absolute
treatment benefits. As a consequence, better risk discrimination also led to
higher discrimination between those with low or high benefit (as reflected in
values of c-for-benefit).</p>
<p>The adaptive approach had adequate median performance, following the “true”
model in most scenarios. With smaller sample sizes it tended to miss the
treatment-baseline risk interaction and selected simpler models (Supplement
Section 4). This conservative behavior resulted in increased RMSE variability in
these scenarios, especially with true strong linear or non-monotonic
deviations. Therefore, with smaller sample sizes the simpler linear interaction
model may be a safer choice for predicting absolute benefits, especially in the
presence of any suspected treatment-related harms.</p>
<p>One limitation is that we assumed treatment benefit to be a function of baseline
risk in the majority of the simulation scenarios. We attempted to expand our
scenarios by considering constant moderate and strong treatment-related harms,
applied on the absolute scale, in line with previous work <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Glasziou1995" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span>. In a
limited set of scenarios with true interactions between treatment assignment and
covariates, our conclusions remained unchanged (Supplement, Section 7). Even
though the average error rates increased for all the considered methods, due to
the miss-specification of the outcome model, the linear interaction model had
the lowest error rates. RCS-3 had very comparable performance. The constant
treatment effect model was often biased, especially with moderate or strong
treatment-related harms. Future simulation studies could explore the effect of
more extensive deviations from risk-based treatment effects.</p>
<p>We only focused on risk-based methods, using baseline risk as a reference in a
two-stage approach to individualizing benefit predictions. However, there is a
plethora of different methods, ranging from treatment effect modeling to
tree-based approaches available in more recent literature <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Athey2019" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>–<a href="references.html#ref-powers2018some" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>. Many of these methods rely on incorporating
treatment-covariate interactions when predicting benefit. An important caveat of
such approaches is their sensitivity to overfitting, which may exaggerate the
magnitude of predicted benefits. In a wide range of simulation settings, a
simpler risk modeling approach was consistently better calibrated for benefit
compared to more complex treatment effect modelling approaches
<span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-vanKlaveren2019" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>. Similarly, when SYNTAX score II, a model developed for
identifying patients with complex coronary artery disease that benefit more from
percutaneous coronary intervention or from coronary artery bypass grafting was
redeveloped using fewer treatment-covariate interactions had better external
performance compared to its predecessor <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-farooq2013anatomical" role="doc-biblioref">22</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-takahashi2020redevelopment" role="doc-biblioref">23</a>]</span>. However, whether this remains the case in a range
of empirical settings still needs to be explored.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the linear interaction approach is a viable option with moderate
sample sizes and/or moderately performing risk prediction models, assuming a
non-constant relative treatment effect plausible. RCS-3 is a better option with
more abundant sample size and when non-monotonic deviations from a constant
relative treatment effect and/or substantial treatment-related harms are
anticipated. Increasing the complexity of the RCS models by increasing the
number of knots does not improve benefit prediction. Using AIC for model
selection is attractive with larger sample size.</p>
