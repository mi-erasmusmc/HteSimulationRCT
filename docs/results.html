<p>The constant treatment effect approach outperformed other approaches in the base
case scenario (N = 4,250; OR = 0.8; AUC= 0.75; no absolute treatment harm)
with a true constant treatment effect (median RMSE: constant treatment effect
0.009;
linear interaction 0.014;
RCS-3 0.018).
The linear interaction model was optimal under true linear deviations
(median RMSE: constant treatment effect
0.027;
linear interaction 0.015;
RCS-3 0.018; Figure  panels A-C)
and even in the presence of true quadratic deviations
(median RMSE: constant treatment effect
0.057;
linear interaction 0.020;
RCS-3 0.021; Figure  panels A-C)
from a constant relative treatment effect. With non-monotonic deviations, RCS-3
slightly outperformed the linear interaction model
(Median RMSE: linear interaction 0.019;
RCS-3 0.018; Figure  panel D).
With strong treatment-related harms the results were very similar in most
scenarios (Figure  panels A-C). Under non-monotonic deviations
the optimal performance of RCS-3 was more pronounced
(Median RMSE: linear interaction 0.024;
RCS-3 0.019; Figure  panel D).
A stronger average treatment effect (OR=0.5) led to larger absolute benefit
predictions and consequently to larger RMSE for all approaches, but the relative
differences between different approaches were similar to the base case scenario
(Supplement, Figure S10).</p>

<p>The adaptive approach had limited loss of performance in terms of the median
RMSE to the best-performing method in each scenario. However, compared to the
best-performing approach, its RMSE was more variable in scenarios with linear
and non-monotonic deviations, especially when also including moderate or strong
treatment-related harms. On closer inspection, we found that this behavior was
caused by selecting the constant treatment effect model in a substantial
proportion of the replications (Supplement, Figure S3).</p>
<p>Increasing the sample size to 17,000 favored RCS-3 the most. The difference in
performance with the linear interaction approach was more limited in settings
with a constant treatment effect
(Median RMSE: linear interaction 0.007;
RCS-3 0.009) and with a true linear interaction
(Median RMSE: linear interaction 0.008;
RCS-3 0.009).
and more emphasized in settings with strong quadratic deviations
(Median RMSE: linear interaction 0.013;
RCS-3 0.011) and non-monotonic deviations
(Median RMSE: linear interaction 0.014;
RCS-3 0.010).
Due to the large sample size, the RMSE of the adaptive approach was even more
similar to the best-performing method, and the constant relative treatment
effect model was less often wrongly selected (Supplement, Figure S4).</p>

<p>Similarly, when we increased the AUC of the true prediction model to 0.85 (OR =
0.8 and N = 4,250), RCS-3 had the lowest RMSE in the case of strong quadratic or
non-monotonic deviations and very comparable performance to the – optimal –
linear interaction model in the case of strong linear deviations (median RMSE of
0.016 for RCS-3 compared to
0.014 for the linear interaction
model). Similar to the base case scenario the adaptive approach wrongly selected
the constant treatment effect model
(23%
and
25%
of the replications in the
strong linear and non-monotonic deviation scenarios without treatment-related
harms, respectively), leading to increased variability of the RMSE (Supplement,
Figure S5).</p>

<p>With a true constant relative treatment effect, discrimination for benefit was
only slightly lower for the linear interaction model, but substantially lower
for the non-linear RCS approaches (Figure ; panel
A). With strong linear or quadratic deviations from a constant relative
treatment effect, all methods discriminated quite similarly (Figure
; panels B-C). With non-monotonic deviations, the
constant effect model had much lower discriminative ability compared to all
other methods
(median AUC of 0.500 for the constant effects model,
0.528
for the linear interaction model and
0.530
Figure ; panel D).
The adaptive approach was unstable in terms of discrimination for benefit,
especially with treatment-related harms. With increasing number of RCS knots, we
observed decreasing median values and increasing variability of the
c-for-benefit in all scenarios. When we increased the sample size to 17,000 we
observed similar trends, however the performance of all methods was more stable
(Supplement, Figure S6). Finally, when we increased the true prediction AUC to
0.85 the adaptive approach was, again, more conservative, especially with
non-monotonic deviations and null or moderate treatment-related harms
(Supplement, Figure S5).</p>

<p>In terms of calibration for benefit, the constant effects model outperformed all
other models in the scenario with true constant treatment effects, but was
miscalibrated for all deviation scenarios (Figure ). The
linear interaction model showed best or close to best calibration across all
scenarios and was only outperformed by RCS-3 in the case of non-monotonic
deviations and treatment-related harms (Figure ; panel
D). The adaptive approach was worse calibrated under strong linear and
non-monotonic deviations compared to the linear interaction model and
RCS-3. When we increased the sample size to 17,000 (Supplement, Figure S6) or
the true prediction AUC to 0.85 (Supplement, Figure S7), RCS-3 was somewhat
better calibrated than the linear interaction model with strong quadratic
deviations.</p>

<p>We used the derived prognostic index to fit a constant treatment effect, a
linear interaction and an RCS-3 model individualizing absolute benefit
predictions. Following our simulation results, RCS-4 and RCS-5 models were
excluded. Finally, an adaptive approach with the 3 candidate models was applied.</p>
<p>All considered methods provided similar fits, predicting increasing benefits for
patients with higher baseline risk predictions, and followed the evolution of
the stratified estimates closely (Figure ). The constant
treatment effect model had somewhat lower AIC compared to the linear interaction
model (AIC:
9,336 versus
9,342),
equal cross-validated discrimination
(c-for-benefit:
0.525),
and slightly better cross-validated calibration
(ICI-for benefit:
0.010 versus
0.012).
In conclusion, although the sample size (30,510 patients;
2,128 events) allowed for flexible modeling approaches, a
simpler constant treatment effect model is adequate for predicting absolute
30-day mortality benefits of treatment with tPA in patients with acute MI.</p>
